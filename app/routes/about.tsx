            <h1>About Vinyl Rewrites</h1>
            <p>
                Vinyl Rewrites is a hands-on introduction to React, designed for those with basic web dev experience
                (HTML/CSS/JS). Over the course of an hour, you'll transform a vinyl-record-themed website into a dynamic
                React appâ€”learning components, JSX, hooks, and state along the way. You'll walk away with a solid
                understanding of how React works and the grooves to get started building your own interactive UIs.
